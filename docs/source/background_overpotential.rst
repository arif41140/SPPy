Background - Overpotential
=========================================================================

As the flow of charges and electrons during battery operations face various sources of resistance, the LIB cell
terminal voltage varies itâ€™s OCV. The magnitude of this deviation of the cell terminal voltage from its equilibrium
potential is referred to as its overpotential \cite{Newman2021}. The overpotential during battery charge and discharge
during a simulation instance is illustrated in the figures (Figures 1 and 2) below.
During battery discharge, the energy lost from overpotential sources
results in a lower cell terminal than its OCV (Figure 1). Similarly, energy spent
overcoming these overpotential sources results in a higher cell terminal voltage than its
OCV (Figure 2).
