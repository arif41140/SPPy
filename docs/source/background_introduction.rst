Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are used as energy storage systems for various transportation and consumer products
applications. LIBs offer high cycling life (roughly 80 \% after 1000-2000 cycles), energy density
(250 – 270 :math:`Whkg^{-1}`), minimum memory effects, and low discharge current. Within an application, the battery pack
(Figure 1A) contains many battery cells or battery modules electrically connected in series or
parallel, and the battery cell comes in various form factors: cylindrical, pouch, or prismatic
(Figure 1B). Within a battery cell, the positive electrode, separator, and negative electrodes are
layered within the current collector. The lithium ions flow within the battery cell while the electrons flow through
the external circuit. Present-day commercial LIB can have a positive electrode that contains one of the various
lithium metal oxides (e.g., lithium manganese oxide, lithium cobalt oxide, lithium iron phosphate, etc.), while the
negative electrode has graphite as its electrochemically active material. Moreover, the electrolyte of commercial LIB
contains lithium salt dissolved in one or a mixture of organic solvents During charge, the lithium-ion de-intercalates
from the intercalation sites within the positive electrode (oxidation),
flows through the electrolyte, and intercalate into the intercalation sites with the electrochemically active negative
electrode material. Meanwhile, the electrons flow from the positive terminal of the LIB to the negative terminal.
The opposite flow of lithium-ions and electrodes occurs within the battery cell and the external circuit, respectively. [1].
